\section{Basic probability}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Law of total probability: $P(A) = \sum_i P(A, B_i)$ (a.k.a. marginalizing over $B$)
\item Chain rule of probability: $P(A,B) = P(A|B) P(B)$
\item Thus, $P(A) = \sum_i P(A|B_i) P(B_i)$
\item Expectation: $E(g(X)) = \sum_x g(x) P(x)$
\item Conditional mean: $E(X|Y) = \sum_x x P(x|y)$
\item Variance: $\sigma_X^2 = E[(X - E(x))^2]$
\item Covariance: $\sigma_{XY} = E[(X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))]$
\item Correlation coefficient: $\rho_{XY}=\sigma_{XY}/(\sigma_X \sigma_Y)$
\item Regression coefficient of $X$ on $Y$: $r_{XY} = \rho_{XY} \sigma_X/\sigma_Y = \sigma_{XY}/(\sigma_Y^2)$ (for the equation $X = r_{XY} Y + c + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$)
\item Conditional independence: $(X \indep Y | Z) \iff P(x|y,z) = P(x|z) $
\end{itemize}

The recursive decomposition of the joint distribution into parents which characterises Bayesian networks is
\begin{equation}
P(x_1, ..., x_n) = \prod_i P(x_i|pa_i) \label{eq:bayes-net-char}
\end{equation}

\subsection{$d$-separation in Bayesian networks}
A path $p$ is $d$-separated (or blocked) by a set of notes $Z$ if and only if
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item $p$ contains a chain $i \rightarrow m \rightarrow j$ or a fork $i \leftarrow m \rightarrow j$ such that the middle node $m$ is in $Z$, or
\item $p$ contains a collider $i \rightarrow m \leftarrow j$ such that the middle node $m$ is not in $Z$ and such that no descendant of $m$ is in $Z$
\end{enumerate}
where an arrow $pa_j \rightarrow x_j$ denotes part of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which variables are represented by nodes and arrows are drawn from each node of the parent set $PA_j$ towards the child node $X_j$.

\paragraph{Probabilistic implications of $d$-separation} 
Consequently, if $X$ and $Y$ are $d$-separated by $Z$ in a DAG $G$, then $(X \indep Y | Z)$ in every distribution compatible with $G$. Conversely, if $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are \textit{not} $d$-separated by $Z$ in a DAG $G$ then $X$ and $Y$ are dependent conditional on $Z$ in almost all distributions compatible with $G$ (assuming no parameter fine-tuning).

\section{Functional causal models}
A functional causal model consists of a set of equations of the form
\begin{equation}
x_i = f_i(pa_i, u_i), \quad i=1,...,n \label{eq:func-caus-mod}
\end{equation}
where $pa_i$ are the set of variables (parents) that directly determine the value of $X_i$ and $U_i$ represents errors (or ``disturbances'') due to omitted factors. When some disturbances $U_i$ are judged to be dependent, it is customary to denote such dependencies in a causal graph with double-headed arrows. If the causal diagram is acyclic, then the corresponding model is called \textit{semi-Markovian} and the values of the variables $X$ are uniquely determined by those of the variables $U$. If the error terms $U$ are jointly independent, the model is called \textit{Markovian}.

Linear structural equation models obey
\begin{equation}
x_i = \sum_{k \neq i} \alpha_{ik} x_k + u_i, \quad i=1,...,n 
\end{equation}
In linear models, $pa_i$ corresponds to variables on the r.h.s.\ of the above equation where $\alpha_{ik} \neq 0$.

\subsection{Counterfactuals in functional causal models: An example}
Consider a randomized clinical trial, where patients are/are not treated $X \in \{0,1\}$. We also observe whether the patients die after treatment $Y\{0,1\}$. We wish to ask the question: did the patient die \textit{because of} the treatment, \textit{despite} the treatment, or \textit{regardless} of the treatment.

Assume $P(y|x) = 0.5$, and therefore $P(y,x)=0.25$ for all $x$ and $y$. We can write two models with the same joint distribution

\textit{Model 1 (treatment no effect):}
\begin{align}
&x=u_1\\
&y=u_2\\
&P(u_1=1) = P(u_2=1)= \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}


\textit{Model 2 (treatment has an effect):}
\begin{align}
&x=u_1\\
&y=xu_2 + (1-x)(1-u_2)\\
&P(u_1=1) = P(u_2=1)= \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}

Let $Q$=fraction of deceased subjects from the treatment group who would not have died had they not taken the treatment. In model 1, $Q=0$ since $X$ has no effect on $Y$. In model 2, subjects who died ($y=1$) and were treated ($x=1$) must correspond to $u_2=1$. If $u_2=1$ then the only way for $y=0$ is for $x=0$. I.e. if you are a patient for whom $u_2=1$ then the only way not to die is to not take the treatment, so the treatment caused your death. So $Q=1$.

Consequence 0: joint probability distributions are insufficient for counterfactual computation

Consequence 1: stochastic causal models are insufficient for counterfactual computation

Consequence 2: functional causal models are sufficient to define and compute counterfactual statements.

\subsection{General method to compute counterfactuals}
Given evidence $e=\{X_{obs}, Y_{obs}\}$, to compute probability of $Y=y$ under hypothetical condition $X=x$ apply the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Abduction: Update the probability of disturbances $P(u)$ to obtain $P(u|e)$
\item Action: Replace the equations corresponding to variables in the set $X$ by the equations $X=x$
\item Prediction: Use the modified model to compute the probability $Y=y$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Causal Bayesian networks}
Given two disjoint sets of variables $X$ and $Y$, the \textbf{causal effect} of $X$ on $Y$, denoted as $P(y|\hat{x})$ or $P(y|do(x))$, is the probability of $Y=y$ by deleting all equations from Eq.\eqref{eq:func-caus-mod} where variables $X$ are on the l.h.s., and substituting $X=x$ in the remaining equations.

This corresponds to mutilating the DAG such that all arrows pointing directly to $X_i$ are removed. \textbf{Amputation is the difference between seeing and doing}.

For an atomic intervention, we get the \textit{truncated factorization} formula
\begin{equation}
P(x_1,...,x_n|\hat{x}'_i)=\begin{dcases}
\prod_{j\neq i} P(x_j|pa_j) \quad &\text{if}\ x_i = x_i'\\
0 &\text{if}\ x_i \neq x_i'
\end{dcases}
\end{equation}
The $j\neq i$ denotes the removal of the term $P(x_i|pa_i)$ from Eq.\eqref{eq:bayes-net-char} (i.e. amputation). A $do(x_i)$ is a severely limited sub-space of the full joint distribution, since the distribution only has support where the intervention variable $x_i$ is equal to its particular intervention value $x_i'$, rather than a continuum of values in Eq.\eqref{eq:bayes-net-char}.

Multiplying and dividing by $P(x'_i|pa_i)$ yields
\begin{equation}
P(x_1,...,x_n|\hat{x}'_i)=\begin{dcases}
P(x_1,...,x_n|x_i',pa_i)P(pa_i) \quad &\text{if}\ x_i = x_i'\\
0 &\text{if}\ x_i \neq x_i'
\end{dcases}
\end{equation}
Marginalization of the above leads to the following theorem.

\paragraph{Adjustment for direct causes} 
Let $PA_i$ denote the set of direct causes of variable $X_i$, and let $Y$ be any set of variables disjoint of $\{X_i \cup PA_i \}$. The causal effect of $do(X_i=x_i')$ on $Y$ is
\begin{equation}
P(y|\hat{x}_i') = \sum_{pa_i} P(y | x'_i, pa_i) P(pa_i)
\end{equation}
where $P(y|x_i', pa_i)$ and $P(pa_i)$ are preintervention probabilities. This is called ``adjusting for $PA_i$''.


\section{Inferring causal relations}
\begin{itemize}
\item IC algorithm is for inferring causal structure given observational data when there are no latent variables
\item IC* algorithm is for inferring causal structure given observational data when there are latent variables. The PC algorithm is apparently more contemporary (see Spirtes et al 2010)
\item There are local criteria for potential cause and genuine cause
\item Spurious association: $X$ and $Y$ are spuriously associated if they are dependent in some context and there exists a latent common cause, as exemplified in the structure $Z_1 \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow Z_2$
\end{itemize}
